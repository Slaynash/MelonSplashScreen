# MelonSplashScreen

## About
This plugin requires a modified version of the [MelonLoader alpha branch](https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader/tree/alpha-development), and is only here for testing purposes.

Due to an issue in the MelonLoader Alpha (as of May 9, 2021), the unhollower call needs to be commented out in the `PreStart` method of `MelonLoader/Core.cs`.

## Supported Unity versions
Il2Cpp, starting 2017.1.0
